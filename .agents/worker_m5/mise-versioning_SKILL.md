# mise-versioning

Drop a uniform `version` / `version:bump-*` task interface onto any repo, regardless of stack.
All bump logic lives in one installed file (`.mise/scripts/versioning.sh`); mise tasks are thin
wrappers. Every version-bearing file in the repo is kept at the same semver — the highest wins.

## The contract this skill guarantees

After `init`, the repo exposes exactly these mise tasks (and nothing the user must learn beyond them):

| task | effect |
|---|---|
| `version` | print current version as `vX.Y.Z` (the highest across all tracked files) |
| `version:bump` / `version:bump-patch` | `vX.Y.Z` → `vX.Y.(Z+1)` (alias — same task) |
| `version:bump-minor` | `vX.Y.Z` → `vX.(Y+1).0` |
| `version:bump-major` | `vX.Y.Z` → `v(X+1).0.0` |
| `version:check` | exit nonzero + list drift if files disagree |
| `version:sync` | force every file up to the highest version |

Every bump rewrites **all** tracked files in their native format and (if tracked) creates a
`vX.Y.Z` git tag, so a frontend `package.json` and a backend `pyproject.toml` never diverge.

## Running `init`

`init` is the single entry point. It is idempotent — safe to re-run.

```bash
bash scripts/init.sh          # run from inside the target repo (cwd anywhere within it)
# flags: --force (re-discover the manifest)  --seed X.Y.Z (initial version)  --no-git-tag
```

What it does, in order:

1. **Ensure mise.** If `mise.toml` is absent, create a minimal one.
2. **Install the engine.** Copy `assets/versioning.sh` → `.mise/scripts/versioning.sh` (chmod +x).
3. **Discover version files** → write `.mise/version-files.conf` (a `<type> <path>` manifest).
4. **Merge the tasks** into `mise.toml` inside a managed `# >>> mise-versioning >>>` block
   (replaced wholesale on re-run, never duplicated).
5. **Resolve parity.** Run `version:check`; if files disagree, `version:sync` to the highest.
6. **Wrap the build.** If `mise.toml` has a `[tasks.build]`, add `depends = ["version:bump-patch"]`.
7. **Flag hardcoded self-reported versions.** Scan source for semver literals fed to
   `--version`-style surfaces (`.version("X.Y.Z")`, `__version__ = …`, `version: "X.Y.Z"`) and
   warn — bumps never rewrite these, so the artifact would lie about itself. Fixing is yours
   (see below); init only detects.

After running, **review `.mise/version-files.conf`** — it is hand-editable and authoritative.
Add or remove entries the auto-discovery missed before relying on bumps.

## After init: judgment the script leaves to you

`init` handles the mechanical 90%. Finish these by hand when they apply:

- **Foreign build runners.** init only auto-wires an existing mise `[tasks.build]`. If the repo
  builds via `npm run build`, a Makefile, `cargo build`, etc., wrap it so the version bumps first:
  ```toml
  [tasks.build]
  depends = ["version:bump-patch"]
  run = "pnpm build"
  ```
  Invoke `mise run build` thereafter, not the underlying tool.
- **Build task that already had `depends`.** init injects a `# NOTE:` rather than guessing merge
  order. Combine into one array with the bump first: `depends = ["version:bump-patch", "…"]`.
- **Unusual version locations.** If a config file's version isn't matched (indented TOML, a
  non-standard property), prefer a canonical `plain` `VERSION` file over fighting the matcher.
  See [references/file-types.md](./references/file-types.md).
- **Self-reported versions — the artifact must derive, not duplicate.** A literal like
  commander's `.version("1.0.0")` or `McpServer({ version: "1.0.0" })` is invisible to the
  manifest and lies a little more every bump (real incident: a CLI shipped as 1.1.3 while
  `--version` said 1.0.0). Make the program read its version from the tracked manifest at
  runtime (Node walk-up to `package.json`, Python `importlib.metadata`, Rust
  `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`, Go ldflags) — recipes and a verify ritual in
  [references/self-reported-version.md](./references/self-reported-version.md). Then prove it:
  `<artifact> --version` must equal `mise run version`. Never "fix" this by regex-tracking the
  source file in the conf.

## How parity & "highest wins" work

The canonical version is computed fresh on every call as the max semver across all manifest
entries. There is no separate "source of truth" file — any tracked file can carry the version, and
they are reconciled upward. This is what lets `init` adopt a repo whose files already disagree:
`version:sync` pulls the laggards up to the leader. Bumps always start from the canonical value, so
a stray un-bumped file can never silently lower the version.

## Supported file types

`json` · `toml` · `cargo` · `csproj` · `gradle` · `plain` · `gittag`. Read/write rules, the
column-0 anchoring that protects dependency pins, and how to add a new type are in
[references/file-types.md](./references/file-types.md).

## Troubleshooting

When a bump touches the wrong line, `check` flags drift after init, the build doesn't bump, or
`current` reads `v0.0.0` in a versioned repo — see [references/gotchas.md](./references/gotchas.md).

## Out of scope

- **Changelogs / release notes.** This skill moves version numbers; it does not write release
  prose. Use the `product-changelog` skill.
- **Publishing / releasing.** No `npm publish`, `uv publish`, `cargo publish`, GitHub Releases, or
  `git push --tags`. Bumps and tags stay local; wire release steps separately.
- **Deriving versions from commit history** (Conventional Commits, semantic-release, release-please).
  This workflow is explicit-bump, not commit-inferred. If the user wants commit-driven versioning,
  that's a different tool — don't bolt it on here.
- **Non-version mise configuration** (tool pinning, env, unrelated tasks). init touches only its
  managed block and an existing `build` task.
